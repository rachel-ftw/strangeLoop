Think about how to use the data to create a chart. We have 2 values: names of the states
and population. There are 6 different categories (6 states) with different numeric values.
The bar chart will be the most appropriate tool to compare the population in New England by state.
Our chart will have 6 buckets, and the height of each bar will depend on population.

1. Use scaleBand to define "buckets" (x coordinate)
2. Use scaleLinear to define the height of the bars (y coordinate)
3. define domains; use map(); and max(); for x and y coordinates;
4. add the attributes to a rectangle based on scaled data: x, y, width, height.
