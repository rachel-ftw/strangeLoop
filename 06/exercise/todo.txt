Bonus:
let's make it responsive!
1. add an event listener to listen window resize event; call chart.render when event registered
2. create updateDimention function:
  a. if width of the window is bigger then 768px, scale your chart.
  b. set up aspect ration where width is equal to a current width of the window minus margins;
  c. height will be calculated from width multiplied by aspect ratio (use .7)

3. create render function
  a. call updateDimentions inside render function
  b. all code that uses width and height put inside render function:
    -- range
    -- margin conversion
    -- scale
    -- axis
    -- draw rectangles based on scaled data
